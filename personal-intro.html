        <h2>Funny story (Even though my entire life is a funny story)</h2>  
        
        <article>The day before the lockdown when I visited a friend of mine. That friend kindly asked if I could drop some glasses ( like 10 bottles ...) 
        in the glasses bubbles, adding that it would be easier if I was opening the hatch instead of drop it one by one. So I opened the hatch and 
        my car key fall in that freaking glass Bubble... And PAF no car anymore, because of course I just had one key. It was in the afternoon and 
        at 8PM we were, me and my BF trying to buy some Junky to get down there (What, not decent ? Well, they are thin and I've tried myself but
         I stay stucked).  
          
        So I waited 3 months for my new key, my friend is still laughing at me with everyone and sometimes I meet people she knows and they say : 
        Hey that's you the girl who dropped her key in the glass bubbles ?   
          
        Yeah ... it's me, glad to be a <span>legend</span> dude, really :')
