        <h2>Funny story (Even though my entire life is a funny story)</h2>

        <article>The day before the lockdown when I visited a friend of mine. That friend kindly asked if I could drop
                some glasses ( like 10 bottles ...)
                in the glasses bubbles, adding that it would be easier if I was opening the hatch instead of drop it one
                by one. So I opened the hatch and
                my car key fall in that freaking glass Bubble... And PAF no car anymore, because of course I just had
                one key. It was in the afternoon and
                at 8PM we were, me and my BF trying to buy some Junky to get down there (What, not decent ? Well, they
                are thin and I've tried myself but
                I stay stucked).

                So I waited 3 months for my new key, my friend is still laughing at me with everyone and sometimes I
                meet people she knows and they say :
                Hey that's you the girl who dropped her key in the glass bubbles ?

                Yeah ... it's me, glad to be a <span>legend</span> dude, really :')
        </article>

        <h4>TL;DR :</h4>

        <p><strong><i>Lazy you...</i></strong></p>

        <p>You have a zipper on your pocket ? Well, use it... you don't know where your key will fall if you don't
        ...
