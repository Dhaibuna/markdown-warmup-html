        1. Spending my life to forget what I have to do ...Full-time job some days **JOKING**
        
        2. Play Video Games  
                * Dragon age saga specially but Heroic Fantasy generally speaking  
                * League of Legends (but I am bad, like ...really bad) 
                * Simulation & strategy games

        3. Read ( You don't wanna know too much about it, there is a risk to be interned in psychiatry)   
        
        <h2>You can always count on me when...</h2>
        
        There is an occasion to go peanut because if so, I could be the one you're looking for :)  
          
        If you know I know something, don't hesitate I will always be glad to help you. And if I can't, I'll search for someone who can 
        ( Also called "After sales services").  
          
        I can also have good ideas, which can be turned in a  weird and confuse big nonsense stuff if you don't contain me, and help me to focus.  
          
        <h2>Funny story (Even though my entire life is a funny story)</h2>  
        
        That day before the lockdown when I visited a friend of mine. That friend kindly asked if I could drop some glasses ( like 10 bottles ...) 
        in the glasses bubbles, adding that it would be easier if I was opening the hatch instead of drop it one by one. So I opened the hatch and 
        my car key fall in that freaking glass Bubble... And PAF no car anymore, because of course I just had one key. It was in the afternoon and 
        at 8PM we were, me and my BF trying to buy some Junky to get down there (What, not decent ? Well, they are thin and I've tried myself but
         I stay stucked).  
          
        So I waited 3 months for my new key, my friend is still laughing at me with everyone and sometimes I meet people she knows and they say : 
        Hey that's you the girl who dropped her key in the glass bubbles ?   
          
        Yeah ... it's me, glad to be a legend dude, really :')  
          
       <h4>TL;DR :</h4> 
        
        **Lazy you...**
        
        You have a zipper on your pocket ? Well, use it... you don't know where your key will fall if you don't ...
